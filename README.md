# Image Matting with A Closed Form Solution

Image Matting is a crucial process in accurately estimating the foreground object in images and videos. It finds extensive applications in various domains, particularly in film production for creating visual effects.

## Overview
This project implements the "A Closed Form Solution to Natural Image Matting" method proposed by A. Levin, D. Lischinski, and Y. Weiss. The method was presented at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in June 2006, New York.

The paper describing the method can be found [here](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~levina/papers/Matting-Levin-Lischinski-Weiss-CVPR06.pdf).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a Python implementation of the image matting technique described in the aforementioned paper. By implementing this method, users can accurately estimate foreground objects in images and videos, which can be beneficial for various image and video editing applications.

## Usage
To use this implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Run the main script to perform image matting on your desired images or videos.
